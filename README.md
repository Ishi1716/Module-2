# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python


## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a Python program to convert the number 16 into its binary representation using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

Assign the value 16 to a variable a.

Use the built-in bin() function to convert the number to binary.

Print the result.

##ðŸ§¾ Program

```python

a=16

print(bin(a))

```

## Output

# Functions in Python: Modulo Calculator

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a Python program that defines a function which accepts two values and returns their modulo using the % operator.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

Define a function called result that takes two arguments a and b.

Inside the function, compute the modulo using a % b.

Print the result of the modulo operation.

Get two integer inputs from the user.

Call the result function with the user-provided values.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

``` python
def result(a,b):

mod=a%b

print(f"modulo is {mod}")

a = int(input())

b = int(input())

```

## Output

# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a Python program that defines a lambda function which takes two arguments a and b, and returns their sum.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

Get two integer inputs from the user.

Use a lambda function to define a function f that returns a + b.

Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

``` python

a=int(input())

b=int(input())

f=lambda a,b:a+b

print(f(a,b))

```

## Output

# ðŸ”º Looping(Patterns)-Pascal's Triangle Generator in Python

This project demonstrates a simple Python program to generate Pascalâ€™s Triangle, where the number of rows is provided by the user.

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a Python program that generates Pascal's Triangle using numbers. The number of rows is accepted from the user.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

Start the program.

Input the number of rows from the user.

Loop from 0 to the number of rows.

For each row:

Print appropriate spaces to shape the triangle.

Compute values using the formula:

[ C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} ]

Print all rows of Pascalâ€™s Triangle.

End the program.

## ðŸ§ª Program

``` python
n=int(input())
for i in range(1,n+1):
    num=1
    for k in range(1,n-i+1):
        print(" ",end="")
    for j in range(0,i):
        if j==0 or i==0:
            num=1
        else:
            num=num*(i-j)//j
        print(num,end=" ")
    print()

```
